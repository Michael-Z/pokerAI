    "## Definition\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "The problem of creating an artificially-intelligent poker-playing agent is well studied. In fact, some variants of the game such as Limit Hold’em are already considered solved[^1]. However, in more complex variants such as No-Limit Hold’em, there are many factors that limit the effectiveness of such game theoretic models as have been proposed thus far. One of the leading contributors to the difficulty of the game of poker from an AI perspective is its imperfect information; because the hole cards of one’s opponents are not known, predicting their response to different possible actions can prove difficult for even the most experienced of human players. This is the specific sub-problem I will attempt to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting a player’s action in a given situation is a perfect example of supervised learning. Given features of the state of the game, the player’s tendencies, the player’s view of his opponents, and the characteristics of the community cards, a supervised model should be able to guess what the player will do next. Note that these features leave out one critical component, which was mentioned earlier: the player’s hole cards. However, as we will see, the combination of a well-engineered feature set and a complex function approximator like a deep neural network can make up for this imperfect information state.\n",
    "\n",
    "All supervised models constructed as part of this project utilized data from HandHQ.com[^2].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The goal of this project is to produce a supervised learning model using Deep Neural Networks trained in TensorFlow to take in features of a poker game and predict the action of whichever player is to act next. The decision of whether to make this a regression or classification problem was tricky, and I have settled on a somewhat ‘middling’ approach: I will do multiclass classification for the actions, but for bets and raises (which have continuous amounts), I will bin the values. This results in the following set of labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fold, Check, Call, Bet-min, Bet-Q Bet-Half, Bet-3Q, Bet-Pot, Bet-3Half, Bet-2, Raise-min, Raise-Q Raise-Half, Raise-3Q, Raise-Pot, Raise-3Half, Raise-2+\n",
    "\n",
    "The amounts associated with bets and raises are relative to the size of the pot. “min” is the minimum legal bet/raise; “Q” is one quarter of the size of the pot; “Half” is half of the size of the pot; “3Q” is three quarters of the size of the pot; “Pot” is a pot-sized bet; “3Half” is 1.5 times the size of the pot; “2+” is 2 or more times the size of the pot, which are all grouped together. Any sizes in between are mapped to their lower bound in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the rules of the game allow for certain actions in certain situations, and because the state of the board is different after each “street” (dealing of community cards), I have decided to break up the model into 7 different models, one applied to each of the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pre-flop, facing a bet\n",
    "- Post-flop, not facing a bet\n",
    "- Post-flop, facing a bet\n",
    "- Post-turn, not facing a bet\n",
    "- Post-turn, facing a bet\n",
    "- Post-river, not facing a bet\n",
    "- Post-river, facing a bet\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason there is no model for “Pre-flop, not facing a bet” is because there are ‘blinds’, which are mandatory bets that begin every game; therefore, there is only one relatively rare situation in which a player would not be facing a bet before the flop, which is in the Big Blind if no bets are made leading up to that player. This is not an interesting prediction problem (they typically check), and there is not enough data to learn this over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is 7 models, each taking a slightly different subset of the full feature set (see Data Preprocessing) and each predicting an action from a subset of the actions described above. In “facing bet” situations, the actions are: fold, call, raise[amount]. In “not facing bet” situations, the actions are: check, bet[amount].\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall procedure for learning these models is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse the raw text of game logs into a feature set providing information on, for each action taken:\n",
    "    1. the play style of the player (e.g. their preflop raise percentage)\n",
    "    2. the player's opponents at the table (e.g. the average stack size)\n",
    "    3. the community cards (e.g. the number of pairs on the board)\n",
    "    4. the state of the game (e.g. the number of players remaining)\n",
    "2. Split the feature set into 7 subsets, separated by the Round and FacingBet fields. For each resulting dataset, take only the corresponding subset of columns (see Data Preprocessing for full lists)\n",
    "3. For each dataset, train a Deep Neural Network to classify actions, assigning more weight to the correct prediction of fold/check/call than to the exact amounts of the bets and raises (see Metrics for a discussion of how to weight these accordingly)\n",
    "4. Evaluate and tune each model using a validation set\n",
    "5. Obtain an overall score over all models to test against the benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "In this section, you will need to clearly define the metrics or calculations you will use to measure performance of a model or result in your project. These calculations and metrics should be justified based on the characteristics of the problem and problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are the metrics you’ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?"
